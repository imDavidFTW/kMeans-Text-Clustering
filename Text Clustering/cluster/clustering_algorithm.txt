clustering algorithm (k-means)

input:
    corpus
    k: number of clusters (In the class Main this is called numCluster.)
    maxIteration: maximum iterations
    n: size of corpus, i.e. the total number of documents

initialization:
    centroid = [0, 1, ..., k-1]
    cluster = array of linked lists, i.e. cluster[i] is the ith cluster, with 0 <= i < k.
    # note: centroid[i] is the centroid of cluster[i]

repeat maxIteration times:(make a for loop or while loop){
    for i = 0 to k-1:
        clear cluster[i]

    for x = 0 to n-1:
        initialize maxIndex
        initialize max
        for i = 0 to k - 1:
            if(similarity of x,centroid[i] > max)
                max = similarity(x,centroid[i])
                maxIndex = i
        i = the index of the cluster with the nearest centroid to x
        # note: nearest means that it has the largest similarity
        add x to cluster[i]

    for i = 0 to k-1:
        // centroid[i] = find the centroid of cluster[i]
        for num : cluster[i]
            for num2 : cluster[i]
                calculate the max similarity using similarity num, num2
                    and save the element num when a new max is found and save the new max similarity calculated
        centroid[i] = the element num that had the max similarity
}

# note: the centroid c in cluster[i] is the element of cluster[i] that maximizes sum(similarity(c, x)), for all x in cluster[i].
# example: cluster[i] = [1, 3, 4], and suppose we have:
#   similarity(1, 1) = 1.0
#   similarity(1, 3) = 0.2
#   similarity(1, 4) = 0.3
#   similarity(3, 1) = 0.2
#   similarity(3, 3) = 1.0
#   similarity(3, 4) = 0.25
#   similarity(4, 1) = 0.3
#   similarity(4, 3) = 0.25
#   similarity(4, 4) = 1.0
#
# then:
#   sum(similarity(1, x)), for all x in cluster[i] = 1.0 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 1.5
#   sum(similarity(3, x)), for all x in cluster[i] = 0.2 + 1.0 + 0.25 = 1.45
#   sum(similarity(4, x)), for all x in cluster[i] = 0.3 + 0.25 + 1.0 = 1.55
# Therefore c=4 is the centroid of cluster[i].
