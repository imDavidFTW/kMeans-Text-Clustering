Text Clustering 

n documents
documents can be news articles,books, etc
The only information we have about the articles is the content (text).

input - array of strings, where each string is a separate news article.
	  - number of desired clusters

clustering analysis: group items based on their similarity.
items that are similar should be in the same cluster.
Dissimilar items should be in separate clusters. 

How can we compute the similarity between two documents
based on the frequency of words in a document
preprocessing steps:
	- removing punctuation, numbers
	- lower case
	- remove stop words. Stop words are the most 
	frequent words in the English language.

sort the words in a document on their frequency.
frequency of these words in the corpus

Convert a document into an array of numbers (found using frequency measures)

similarity function applied on the arrays of numbers

implement a clustering algorithm; k-means, k is the number of desired clusters.

objects:

 - file reader: read files that contains the text and convert them to strings

 - clustering algorithm

 - text preprocessing: contains functions used in pre processing steps

 - corpus - stores all of the documents 

 - document: content, word frequency, similarity function

corpus: n documents
documents: terms or words
